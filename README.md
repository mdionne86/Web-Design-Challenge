# Web-Design-Challenge

## Design
Using a few methods stitched together (CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, Pandas) I was able to create a simple website format to display the results of our past activity charting the weather. I definitely opt for minimal design, and chose not to add additional clutter elements on the page. 

## Publishing
This took some fussing, as this was my first time publishing a separate repository. While using my local machine, capitalization in some of the URL's seemed to be lax. When I uploaded to git, suddenly things weren't working and I had to go through again to clean the code for this.
